/**
 * Per-userId rate limiting for the MCP tools.
 *
 * The threat we're guarding against is a stolen MCP Bearer token. Tokens are
 * 30-day HMAC-secret-bound; a leaked grant gives the holder full read+write
 * access to the user's library. Rate limits narrow the blast radius without
 * requiring a revocation surface area we don't have today.
 *
 * Implementation: a fixed-window counter in Redis, keyed by `userId` and
 * the bucket name. We pick fixed window over a sliding log because it stays
 * O(1) per request and gives the operator an easy knob (the `limit`
 * constant). The window is short enough that an attacker can't amortize
 * the burst and long enough not to feel like a quota.
 *
 * When Redis is unavailable, `incrementMcpRateCounter` returns `null`
 * (fail-open) because we'd rather degrade UX than block legitimate user
 * actions during an infrastructure blip. The danger is bounded: stealing
 * a token still gives the user their existing library access; rate-limits
 * are a defense in depth, not the only line.
 *
 * No `import "server-only"` here on purpose: this module's only callers are
 * the MCP route handler (a Next.js server route); pulling in the client
 * import attempt would be caught at the route, not at this leaf. Adding the
 * marker would also keep us from unit-testing the decision helpers without a
 * preload hack.
